# Developer Notes

## AWS Setup
In the AWS Management Console I:
1. created a Group
2. added the AllS3 policy to the group
3. created a user
4. created an access key for that user

I then ran `aws configure` in the terminal and configured the aws cli. 

6. Added a limited DynamoDB policy to the group
